# CubeNet

Using TL (Transfer Learning) on the MobileNet-SSD detection model, combined with the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm for classifying colors in the LAB color space, this AI can detect and perceive Rubikâ€™s cubes from your webcam in real time, work out the solution, and show the user how to solve it. This combination of technologies allows it to work in any background and under many different lighting conditions.

Frameworks used: Tensorflow, OpenCV, NumPy.
